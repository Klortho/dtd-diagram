* front-stub has a problem (article/sub-article/front-stub)
    * For testing, is there any way to inject a fixed tree, rather than creating 
      it from the DTD specs?

* Fix the nodeSize function so that it returns the real sizes
    * First for choice/seq nodes
        * [c] Fix the separation - it should be according to elem_parent, not
          parent.



    * then for element/attribute nodes




* What does the top-level tree data look like, now, before tree.nodes() is
  called? And, what do I want it to look like?
