* promise-ize all transitions, again.


* Cowbell
    * All the text for a given node type should be the same color, incl.
      q and label
    * Each node type should be a different color, except maybe choice/seq
    * Maybe also shrink the corner radii of ElementNodes, and make AttributeNodes'
      boxes oval.
    * Fix sequence node shape
    * Use SVG to draw q
    * Use SVG to draw button labels "@" and "<>"
    * diagonals should come right out of their buttons: i.e. source vertical
      coord should depend on button loc.

* Get rid of jQuery
